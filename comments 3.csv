Here are 20 teachings from the wisest person of this century (that will change your life too):"
https://twitter.com/ecomEddie/status/1760653751520555324,"Desire Is Your Enemy

Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. It’s a bottomless pit meant to keep you enslaved."
https://twitter.com/ecomEddie/status/1760653751520555324,"To lead a happy life, you must detach from your desires.

The man who isn’t content with little won’t be content with more."
https://twitter.com/ecomEddie/status/1760653751520555324,"Say No

Time is life's currency. That’s why you must guard it like your most precious asset.

The best way to do that is by saying ‘No’ more often than you say ‘Yes’.

If you don’t, you’ll always be over-committing."
https://twitter.com/ecomEddie/status/1760653751520555324,"Never Stop Learning

When you stop learning, you stop earning. That’s why you must develop an appetite for reading.

Read what you love until you love to read. Only dive into books that fascinate you.

Learn for deep understanding, not trivia.

Read with passion, not pressure."

https://twitter.com/OrangeSoylent/status/1760686386586546401,My mother dropped me off at the airport earlier and handed me $200 for a little spending money on my trip. I’m 50 years old…
